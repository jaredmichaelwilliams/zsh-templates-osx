#  bitrot is a zsh shell script/function that uses OS X built-in utilities to associate a       #
#  SHA-1 checksum (or hash) of the audio data in an m4a file and writes the hash code into      #
#  the resource fork associated with that file, using afhash and xattr. This has the            #
#  advantage of not altering the audio file itself. This assumes you have stored your           #
#  music on an HFS+ formatted (default OS X) hard drive, or some other resource-fork            #
#  friendly filesystem (like zfs). To preserve resource forks, you need to use OS X copy        #
#  utilities that are resource-fork aware.  Please note that checksum will only be              #
#  computed for integer linear PCM or losslessly encoded data whose sample frequency is         #
#  greater than or equal to 44100 Hz and bit depth is greater than or equal to 16, which        #
#  are limitations imposed by the afhash utility in OS X.  man afhash for more info.            #
#                                                                                               #
#                                                                                               #
#     How to use it:                                                                            #
#                                                                                               #
#  (a) To generate the checksums:     bitrot -w                                                 #
#                                                                                               #
#  Run bitrot from the top-level directory containing all your m4a music files. If you          #
#  allow iTunes to organize your music, this will most likely be the directory                  #
#   ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Media/Music                                                          #
#  Invoke bitrot with the -w flag to generate the checksums for each of the                     #
#  audio files and to write these values into the associated resource fork.                     #
#                                                                                               #
#                                                                                               #
#  (b) To check the integrity of files at a later time:     bitrot -c                           #
#                                                                                               #
#  Run bitrot from the top-level directory or the directory containing the music files          #
#  in question. Invoke bitrot with the -c flag to compare the current checksum with             #
#  what is stored in the resource fork.  If they don't match, this indicates the audio          #
#  portion of the file has somehow changed.  The checksum should not change if you have         #
#  only manipulated the tags or so-called metadata in iTunes or other tag-editing software.     #
#  Mismatches are logged to dated logfiles in $bitrotlog                                        #
#                                                                                               #
#                                                                                               #
#  (c) To view checksums added to the resource forks:     bitrot -l                             #
#                                                                                               #
#  Run bitrot from the top-level directory or the directory containing the music files          #
#  in question using the -l flag to view checksums added to the resource forks.                 #
#                                                                                               #
#                                                                                               #
#  (d) To delete the checksums from resource forks:     bitrot -d                               #
#                                                                                               #
#  Run bitrot from the top-level directory or the directory containing the music files          #
#  in question. Invoke bitrot with the -d flag to remove the current checksum. Plese            #
#  note that you never should have to do this. Re-running bitrot with -w will update the        #
#  checksums.                                                                                   #
